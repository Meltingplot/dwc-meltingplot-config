# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

**dwc-meltingplot-config** is a Python-based configuration project for Meltingplot. The repository is in its initial setup phase.

## Repository Structure

```
dwc-meltingplot-config/
├── .gitignore          # Python-oriented gitignore (covers venvs, build artifacts, IDE files, etc.)
└── CLAUDE.md           # This file
```

## Language & Ecosystem

- **Primary language:** Python
- **Ignored tooling artifacts:** The `.gitignore` covers Python bytecode, virtual environments (venv, pipenv, poetry, pdm, uv, pixi), build/dist directories, test/coverage reports, and common IDE configurations (PyCharm, VS Code, Cursor).

## Development Setup

No build system, dependency manager, or project configuration (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`) has been added yet. When these are introduced, update this section with:

- How to create and activate a virtual environment
- How to install dependencies
- How to run the project

## Testing

No test framework is configured yet. When tests are added, document:

- Test framework (e.g., pytest, unittest)
- How to run tests (`pytest`, `python -m pytest`, etc.)
- Test file naming conventions and directory structure

## Linting & Formatting

No linting or formatting tools are configured yet. When added, document:

- Linter (e.g., ruff, flake8, pylint)
- Formatter (e.g., ruff format, black)
- Type checker (e.g., mypy, pyright)
- How to run checks locally

## CI/CD

No CI/CD pipelines are configured yet.

## Git Workflow

- **Default remote branch:** `main`
- **Commit messages:** Use clear, descriptive messages summarizing the change

## Conventions for AI Assistants

- This is a Python project. Follow Python community conventions (PEP 8, PEP 257).
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Do not add unnecessary abstractions or over-engineer solutions.
- Keep this CLAUDE.md updated as the project evolves — add build commands, test instructions, and architectural notes as they become relevant.
